  Eggs in the Morning <br><br>
  The cutest girl works in my college dining commons and we met by accident. I set my alarm for 6 am instead of 7 am and was so tired that I actually left an hour early to go to class. I had to grab something to eat so I went to the dining commons to get some quick breakfast and saw her working on this huge grill with a uniform and this red bandana matching her nails. <br>
  I really wanted to get to know her after I saw her the first time. I started waking up an hour early every day because apparently her shift ended by 8 am. I started by ordering two eggs every day, but it wasn’t enough time to talk. So I started ordering six eggs every single day and stood there while she made them. I was hoping she would talk to me one of these days with more than the casual “good morning, how are you?”. Then one day I just couldn’t take it anymore and said, “It’s obvious no one is going to introduce us, and we don’t have any friends in common. So I’m going to just come out with it. Would you like to go to dinner with me?” I swear my heart was beating double time. She looked me in the eye and said “I thought you’d never ask”, while staring into my eyes. In her eyes, I saw it all. It was as if we were meant to be. Fast forward 6 months and we’re together, and if I relived this life I would do it all the same.<br>
