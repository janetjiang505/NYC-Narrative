  Fourth Aisle Window Seat <br><br>
  I had been working up the courage to talk to him for an entire month. He sat in the same seat every day, fourth aisle, window seat. He usually listened to music with his earbuds, tapping his feet to the beat. On other days, he would take out a sketchpad and just watch the people around him. He placed his bag on the chair next to him; nobody needed the seat anyways. It was like a daily routine: I would walk onto the bus, see the familiar mop of brown hair, and stare at the floor as I walked past him.<br>
  One day, however, I decided that enough was enough. I was done fantasizing over someone whose name I didn’t even know. That day was the day I finally introduced myself. I walked onto the bus, feeling unsure but at the same time determined. When I spotted him, I resisted the urge to lower my eyes and approached him, my palms clammy.<br>
  I reached his aisle and opened my mouth to talk. He looked up and I drowned in his sea green eyes. At that exact moment, the bus driver decided to start driving and the entire bus lurched forward. I was definitely not expecting that and wasn’t holding onto anything. So, I fell backwards onto my butt. But it didn’t stop there; I rolled all the way to the front of the bus, hitting my head on the door. When I stood up, I saw a mixture of looks of pity, concern, and amusement. I couldn’t bear to look at him as I got off the bus and walked home.</div>
