  Rite Aid Boy <br><br>
  My favorite neighborhood changes every month. Just as often as my crush changes. Last week I was in love with the Dominican boy from Rite Aid. He worked on 146th and Broadway, so for a month, my favorite neighborhood was Harlem. I took the A train 8 stops from 207th. Twenty minutes on the train when there was no train traffic or 30 minutes when I had to wait on the sticky wood subway benches. <br>
  Three weeks into my romance with the boy from Rite Aid I met Lucas. It was the second Monday of August. I sat at the 207th street subway station in my pale yellow sundress. My thighs stuck to the glossy wooden bench underneath my legs. Impatiently, I played with my hair daydreaming about how I would accidentally bump into the boy from Rite Aid. I would drop the collection of shampoos and conditioners that I picked up from aisle 5. He would blush and repeatedly apologize for walking into me. I was so caught up in my daydream that I almost didnâ€™t notice the tall blonde boy sit down next to me. . . almost.<br>
