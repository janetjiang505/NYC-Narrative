  Used to <br><br>
  “I used to...” is how I tell all my stories. I used not want to wake up the next day. I used to want to leave this place. I used to think I was a waste of space. I used to be homeless. It’s all a “used to”. <br>
  Coming to Brooklyn with my mom was the the turning point. All of my “used to’s” became non-existent. New York City changed me. I left all my memories behind in my old town and was able to start anew. Everyone had their own stories here and I wasn’t alone anymore. It didn’t matter anymore where I came from nor the fact that my father was in jail for robbery. I was free of everyone judging me. In my neighborhood in Brooklyn, everyone has their hardships and struggles. No one pretends to be perfect like in my old town. It’s as if a cage has been lifted and I’m now free to breathe. Never in a million years did I think that could be possible. <br>
