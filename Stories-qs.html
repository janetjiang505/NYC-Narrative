  Picking the Big Apple <br><br>
  I’m not originally from New York; I was born and raised in Ada, Oklahoma. I used to be comforted by the smell of dirt and the heat of warm Oklahoma sun on my shoulders. The first 18 years of my life I lived on a farm with my large family. 14 hands helping pick apples and 7 lips chattering as we worked. I grew up with more cousins than I can count and the number of animals on our farm was double that. I loved my life in Oklahoma and often times throughout this year I have found myself reminiscing about the warm Oklahoma sun. But you can ask any member of my family and they would tell you that I belonged in the City. <br>
  I constantly talked about leaving the farm for New York City. My aspirations started as a family joke. An absurd idea… me leaving for New York? No way. I applied to NYU in secret, wanting to shield my young dream for as long as possible from its grim fate.
  When I got accepted to NYU, I told no one for 3 weeks. I was so excited at the prospect of living independently in the city that never sleeps. I envisioned drinking coffee at the Hungarian Pastry shop, riding a rented bike in Central Park, and visiting the Moma.
  Upon arriving at Laguardia airport, I got my first glimpse of the city. I was in love. I took my first train ride on the A line. In one hand I held tight to the handle of my mother’s suitcase and in the other, I had a subway map that my father had given to me before I left. Fully fixated on the map, it wasn’t until 14th street that I realized I had missed my stop. I hustled off the train and followed the swamp of people in front of me. As I was climbing the stairs I held my nose high, picturing myself in a coming of age movie. All of a sudden, I was falling.<br>
  My suitcase wheel had gotten caught on one the edge of one of the stairs. I was flung backward. I tumbled to the bottom of the stairs and crumpled into a motionless heap. OUCH! My suitcase next to me, my fingers still wrapped tightly around the handle. “In New York thieves are everywhere!! Hold on tightly to your belongings.” My mother’s outdated advice rang in my head. I was on the floor of the 14th street subway exit, but at least no one had stolen my suitcase. Slowly, as  I started to stand up, a tall man stepped right over me. His long legs stretched to avoid stepping on my crumpled body. New York stops for no one.</div>
