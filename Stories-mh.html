  Before I share my crazy story, let me just give you some background about myself. First I’ll paint you a picture of what I looked like in 7th grade. I was 207 pounds and 5’4… pretty big. . . yeah I know. Weirdly, my prepubescent body had an annoying way of distributing my body fat, sending my of it to my hips and my butt. I was hefty and in a really feminine way. My hair was definitely not helping my manly middle school image. My straight black hair was shabby and long, it was months since my mom had cut it. It was the middle of winter, so basically my excuse to not wash my hair for a few weeks. I was wearing my brother’s hand-me-down, a large down jacket that didn’t make me look any smaller than I actually was. <br>
  Anyways, now that you have an image in your head of the mess that I was in 7th grade, I’ll tell you about a cold winter morning before school. I left my house before the sun was fully up. It was winter, so it could be 7 A.M. and still be dark outside. With my chin tucked into my chest I walked down the steps from my apartment building, trying my best to conserve heat. My hands shoved into my pocket I walked briskly towards the subway. As I was turning the corner, I heard a shout come from the parked van to my right, “Ay Mami, turn around give me a smile.” Instinctively, my head whipped around to see two men in a van. Immediately, they jolted back in their seats. “Oh shit! Sorry bro, we thought you were a lady.” The one closer to me mustered between his chuckles. I shoved my hands deeper into my pockets and quickly shuffled away, my hips swinging side to side. </div>
